   <br>
  <li>WEBSITE ACCESS AND TERMS,

   If you choose to register an account or when you place your first order, we will provide you with a user name and you will select a password. You are responsible for keeping this user name and password secure and are responsible for all use and activity carried out under this user name.</li>
  <li> Acceptance of terms: By accessing any part of the Website, you indicate that you accept these Website Terms. If you do not accept these Website Terms, you should leave the Website immediately, and you will not be able to order any Products through the Website.</li>

You are also responsible for ensuring that all persons who access the Website through your Internet connection are aware of these Website Terms and that they comply with them.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>

  <br>

   <li> YOUR STATUS
   <ol>
   <li>Capacity and age: By placing an Order through the Website, you warrant that:
   <ol>
   <li> You are legally capable of entering into binding contracts; and</li>
   <li> You are at least 18 years old.</li>
   </ol>
   </li>

  <li> Alcohol and cigarettes: Furthermore, you acknowledge and agree that:
  <ol>
  <li>it is an offence for any person under the age of 18 to buy, or attempt to buy, intoxicating liquor, or for any person over the age of 18 to buy intoxicating liquor on behalf of any person under the age of 18;</li>
  <li>Cigarettes are not for sale to persons under the age of 18; and</li>
  <li>Orders containing either alcohol or cigarettes can therefore not be accepted from or on behalf of persons under the age of 18. In the event that you place an order for alcohol or tobacco products, you will be required by the restaurant to show ID on delivery. For the avoidance of doubt, if your Order includes alcohol or tobacco, the Restaurant is providing you with these and Menuzapp is not selling alcohol or tobacco to you. Menuzapp supports the Responsible Service of Alcohol.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  </ol>
  </li>
   <br>

  <li>HOW TO MAKE AN ORDER AND HOW IT IS PROCESSED
  <ol>
  <li> Compiling your Order: Once you select the Products you wish to order from the menu of your chosen Restaurant and provide other required information, you will be given the opportunity to submit your Order by clicking or selecting the "buy", "place order", "checkout" or similar button. It is important that you check all the information that you enter and correct any errors before clicking or selecting this button; once you do so we will process your Order and errors cannot be corrected.</li>
  <li> Minimum Order Amount: If a Restaurant has a minimum order amount in place, you may not place an order with that Restaurant until the value of your Order exceeds that amount. The minimum order amount must be met after applying any discounts or specials that reduce the total Order amount.</li>
  <li> Amending or cancelling your Order: Once you submit your Order and your payment has been authorised, you will not be entitled to change or cancel your Order online (please refer to paragraph for details of the process relating to rejected Orders). If you wish to change or cancel your Order, you may contact the Restaurant directly or our Customer Care team as described in paragraph 6.3 and they will attempt to contact the Restaurant in order to communicate your requests. However, there is no guarantee that we will be able to reach the Restaurant or that the Restaurant will agree to your requests as they may have already started to process your Order.</li>
  <li> Payment authorisation: Where any payment you make is not authorised, your Order will not be processed by or communicated to the relevant Restaurant.</li>
  <li> Processing your Order and Restaurant rejections: On receipt of your Order, we will begin processing it by sending it to the relevant Restaurant and will notify you within the website and/or mobile application that your Order has been received and is being processed. Any confirmation page that you may see on the Website and any Order confirmation e-mail that you may receive each merely indicate that your Order has been received and is being processed by us, and does not necessarily mean that your Order has been accepted by the Restaurant. Restaurants have the discretion to reject Orders at any time because they are too busy, due to weather conditions or for any other reason. We encourage all our Restaurants to accept all Orders and to communicate any rejection promptly, and we will notify you (generally by email) as soon as reasonably practicable if a Restaurant rejects your Order.When a Restaurant confirms receipt of the order and expected collection or delivery time, we will send you a confirmation notification within the website and/or mobile application (provided that you have mobile notifications enabled).</li>
  <li> Delivery of your Order: Estimated times for deliveries and collections are provided by the Restaurants and are only estimates. Neither we nor the Restaurants guarantee that Orders will be delivered or will be available for collection within the estimated times. All food preparation and deliveries are the sole responsibility of the Restaurant accepting the Order. To the extent permitted by law, including the Australian Consumer Law, Menuzapp accepts no liability associated with food preparation or delivery by the Restaurant accepting the order.</li>

  </li>
  <br>


    <li> PRICE AND PAYMENT
    <ol>
    <li>Taxes and delivery costs: Prices for individual menu items will be as quoted on the Website in Australian dollars. These prices include any applicable taxes but may exclude  payment transactions costs and any online payment administration charge imposed by the Restaurant. These will be added to the total amount due where applicable.</li>
    <li> Incorrect pricing: This Website contains a large number of menus and it is possible that some of the menus may include incorrect prices. The products will be sold for the displayed price even if the correct price for an Order is higher than the price stated on the Website.</li>
    <li> Payment methods: Payment for Orders must be made by an accepted credit or debit card,or any other payment method offered through the Website.</li>
    <li> Card payments: If you pay by credit or debit card, you may be required to show the card to the Restaurant at the time of collection as proof of identification and so that they can check that the card conforms with the receipt data for the Order. Please note that from time to time there may be delays with the processing of card payments and transactions; this may result in delays in sums being deducted from your bank account or charged to your credit or debit card.</li>
    <li>Credit and discount vouchers: A credit or discount may apply to your Order if you use a promotional voucher or code recognised by the Website and endorsed by Menuzapp, and you pay for any balance by credit or debit card. Please refer to our Voucher Terms & Conditions for the full terms and conditions applicable to the use of credit and discount vouchers.</li>
    <li>Rejected Orders: Once you have submitted an Order that you are paying for by credit or debit card and your payment has been authorised, you will be charged the full amount of your Order. If your Order is subsequently rejected by the Restaurant (as described in paragraph 4.4 above) or cancelled for any other reason, your bank or card issuer will refund the relevant amount. However, this may take between 3 to 5 working days (or longer, depending on your bank or card issuer). You acknowledge and agree that neither we nor the relevant Restaurant will be responsible or liable to you in relation to this delay by your bank or card issuer in the release of funds back into your account.
